```

**The rule:** components only render. Canvas mutations live in hooks and `lib/fabric-helpers.ts` so they can be reasoned about (and later tested) independently of React.

## 🚀 Setup & Run

Requires **Node.js 18.18+**. Check your version with `node -v`.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/mohd-hassan17/Darkroom-image-editor.git
cd darkroom-image-editor

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Other scripts

```bash
npm run build   # Production build (also runs TypeScript type-check)
npm run start   # Serve the production build
npm run lint    # ESLint
```

Both `lint` and `build` pass with zero errors/warnings.

## 📦 Export JSON Format

When you click **Export → Annotation data (JSON)**, you get a file shaped like this:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "image": {
    "fileName": "photo.png",
    "originalWidth": 1920,
    "originalHeight": 1080,
    "mimeType": "image/png",
    "uploadedAt": "2026-07-02T10:30:00.000Z"
  },
  "edit": {
    "rotationDegrees": 90,
    "cropApplied": true,
    "zoomLevel": 0.65,
    "lastModified": "2026-07-02T10:35:00.000Z"
  },
  "canvasObjects": {
    "objects": [ ...all paths, shapes, text objects... ]
  }
}
```

`canvasObjects` is Fabric.js's own serialization format — it contains every annotation object's position, style, and type, and can be loaded back into a canvas with `canvas.loadFromJSON()`.

## 🔑 Key Implementation Decisions

**Logical vs. display size**
The canvas's true pixel dimensions are fixed once from the uploaded image. Zoom is purely a display-time scale (`canvas.setZoom`) — object coordinates never change with window size. Export temporarily resets to 1:1 zoom, captures at full resolution, then restores the view.

**Undo / redo as a snapshot stack**
Full-canvas JSON snapshots rather than a command/diff pattern. Simpler to reason about and correct by construction — Fabric already serializes every object type in use, so there's nothing to miss.

**Crop mode derived from active tool**
`isCropMode` is not separate state — it's derived directly from `activeTool === "crop"`. One source of truth, no sync bugs.

**Fabric.js + React integration**
Fabric owns the canvas imperatively; React owns the UI. The boundary is `useFabricCanvas` — it creates the canvas once in a `useEffect`, exposes the instance via context, and every tool panel communicates with it through helper functions, not direct DOM access.
